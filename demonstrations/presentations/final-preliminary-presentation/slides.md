# What is YARTBML?

Minimally Functional-Paradigm Inspired Language (Based on SMoL)

<v-clicks>

- üõ† Built on the foundation provided by Thorsten Ball's: "Writing an Interpreter in Go"
- üí≠ Inspired by the many forks of this foundation to provide the best feature set and experience
- üë©‚Äçüíª Focuses on the developer experience for building general-purpose applications
- üçï Learnable in a lunch break

</v-clicks>

# Data Types

<v-clicks>

- Integers: Whole numbers without a decimal component, e.g., `42`, `-7`.
- Booleans: Logical type representing `true` or `false`.
- Strings: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, e.g., `"YARTBML is awesome!"`.
- Arrays: A list of elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, "hello", true]`.
- Hashmaps: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{"name": "YARTBML", "isCool": true}`.

</v-clicks>

<!--
As you can see, the array element can accept objects of many different types.
Same goes for hashmaps.

# Data Types In Action

````md magic-move
```js
let answerToLife = 42;      // Integers
let isLanguageCool = true;  // Booleans
let name = "YARTBML";       // Strings
```
```js
// Each Team Member's Profile in a Hashmap
let dinesh = {"name": "Dinesh Umasankar", classification: "Senior"};
let joseph = {"name": "Joseph Porrino", classification: "Senior"};
let katherine = {"name": "Katherine Banis", classification: "Senior"};
let paul = {"name": "Paul Jensen", classification: "Senior"};

let dineshClassification = dinesh["classification"] // "Senior"
```
```js
// Our team in an array
let team = [dinesh, joseph, katherine, paul];
let leader = team[0] // {"name": "Dinesh Umasankar", classification: "Senior"}
```

# Functions
<br/>

<v-clicks>

- First-Class Citizens
- Functions are a value-type

</v-clicks>

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- Can be assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments
- Returned from other functions

</v-clicks>

```js {hide|1|2|3|all}
let greet = fn(name) { return "Hello, " + name + "!"; };
let message = greet("World");
puts(message); // -> "Hello, World!"
```

# Operators
## Traditional Arithmetic Operators w/ Precedence

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- Equality-Expression: `==` or `!=`
- Comparative Expression: `<` or `>`
- Additive-Expression: `+` or `-`
- Multiplicative-Expression: `*` or `/`
- Prefix-Expression: `-` or `!`

# **Project Components**

# Lexer

<br/>
<v-clicks>

- Purpose is to tokenize text so parser can create an AST
- A token is a struct that holds a type and literal

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

```js
type Token struct {
	Type    TokenType
	Literal string
}
```

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

- Lexer increments over each char in input string
- Tokenizes: Operators, delimiters, identifiers, keywords, and numbers

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

```js
>> let x = 5
{Type:LET Literal:let}
{Type:IDENT Literal:x}
{Type:= Literal:=}
{Type:INT Literal:5}
>>
```

</v-clicks>

# Parser

<v-clicks>

- Pratt parsing
- The image represents ```let x = 5``` as an AST
- Input are tokens from lexer
- Tokens get parsed and nodes are created

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

```js
type LetStatement struct {
  Token token.Token // token.LET token
  Name  *Identifier
  Value Expression
}
```

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

- AST is built by appending nodes to a list

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

```js
stmt := p.parseStatement()
if stmt != nil {
  program.Statements = append(program.Statements, stmt)
}
p.nextToken()

```

</v-clicks>

# Evaluator

<v-clicks>

- Tree walks AST
- Start from root of AST and recurisvely call each node
- Values are represented as objects to be passed through evaluator
- Environment holds identifier bindings

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

```js
func Eval(node ast.Node, env *object.Environment) object.Object {
	switch node := node.(type) {
	// Statements
	case *ast.Program:
		return evalProgram(node, env)

	case *ast.ExpressionStatement:
		return Eval(node.Expression, env)

	case *ast.IntegerLiteral:
		return &object.Integer{Value: node.Value}

```

# Memory Management
## Handled by Go Language

<v-clicks>

- Go's Runtime is statically linked into the interpreter binary, which contains a Garbage Collector.

- Interpreter is a binary file compiled to a specific machine architecture.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Let dinesh take over this slide for explanation.

It discusses about how the memory management is relegated to our host language: Go.
