# What is YARTBML?

Minimally Functional-Paradigm Inspired Language (Based on SMoL)

<v-clicks>

- üõ† Built on the foundation provided by Thorsten Ball's: "Writing an Interpreter in Go"
- üí≠ Inspired by the many forks of this foundation to provide the best feature set and experience
- üë©‚Äçüíª Focuses on the developer experience for building general-purpose applications
- üçï Learnable in a lunch break

# **Let's Prove It**

---
---

# File Format

<br/>
<v-clicks>

- To start writing code in YARTBML, make a `.ybml` file.
- All programs will be interpreted under UTF-8, and English Alphanumeric Characters only.
- Let's make an example fibonacci program.

</v-clicks>

# Fibonacci Program

<div class="font-italic text-sm">fibonacci.ybml</div>
```js {1|2-4|5-9|13|all}
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        if (x == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
        }
    }
};

puts(fibonacci(10)) // Displays "55".
```

# **Core Language Principles**

# Parsing
Pratt Parsing Technique (form of Recursive Descent)

# Interpreter / Evaluator
Tree-Walking Interpreter using the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

# Data Types

<v-clicks>

- Integers: Whole numbers without a decimal component, e.g., `42`, `-7`.
- Booleans: Logical type representing `true` or `false`.
- Strings: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, e.g., `"YARTBML is awesome!"`.
- Arrays: A list of elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, "hello", true]`.
- Hashmaps: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{"name": "YARTBML", "isCool": true}`.

# Data Types In Action

````md magic-move
```js
let answerToLife = 42;      // Integers
let isLanguageCool = true;  // Booleans
let name = "YARTBML";       // Strings
```
```js
// Each Team Member's Profile in a Hashmap
let dinesh = {"name": "Dinesh Umasankar", classification: "Senior"};
let joesph = {"name": "Joesph Porrino", classification: "Senior"};
let katherine = {"name": "Katherine Banis", classification: "Senior"};
let paul = {"name": "Paul Jensen", classification: "Senior"};

let dineshClassification = dinesh["classification"] // "Senior"
```
```js
// Our team in an array
let team = [dinesh, joesph, katherine, paul];
let leader = team[0] // {"name": "Dinesh Umasankar", classification: "Senior"}

# Functions
<br/>

<v-clicks>

- First-Class Citizens
- Functions are a value-type

</v-clicks>

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- Can be assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments
- Returned from other functions

</v-clicks>

```js {hide|1|2|3|all}
let greet = fn(name) { return "Hello, " + name + "!"; };
let message = greet("World");
puts(message); // -> "Hello, World!"
```

# Operators
## Traditional Arithmetic Operators w/ Precedence

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- Equality-Expression: `==` or `!=`
- Comparative Expression: `<` or `>`
- Additive-Expression: `+` or `-`
- Multiplicative-Expression: `*` or `/`
- Prefix-Expression: `-` or `!`

</v-clicks>

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- **(FUTURE)** *Operator Support for `<=` and `>=`*
- **(FUTURE)** *Logical Operator Support: `&&` and `||`*

# Memory Management
## Handled by Go Language

<v-clicks>

- Go's Runtime is statically linked into the interpreter binary, which contains a Garbage Collector.

- Interpreter is a binary file compiled to a specific machine architecture.

# Built-In Functions

<br/>

<v-clicks>

- `len`: gets length of characters in string or elements in array
- `first`: gets first element within array
- `last`: gets last element within array
- `rest`: gets rest of elements within array
- `push`: pushes an element at index 0 *(prepend)*
- `puts`: display object to terminal *(print)*
