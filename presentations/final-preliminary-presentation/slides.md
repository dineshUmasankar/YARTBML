# What is YARTBML?

Minimally Functional-Paradigm Inspired Language (Based on SMoL)

<v-clicks>

- üõ† Built on the foundation provided by Thorsten Ball's: "Writing an Interpreter in Go"
- üí≠ Inspired by the many forks of this foundation to provide the best feature set and experience
- üë©‚Äçüíª Focuses on the developer experience for building general-purpose applications
- üçï Learnable in a lunch break

# File Format

<br/>
<v-clicks>

- To start writing code in YARTBML, make a `.ybml` file.
- All programs will be interpreted under UTF-8, and English Alphanumeric Characters only.
- Let's make an example fibonacci program.

# Fibonacci Program

<div class="font-italic text-sm">fibonacci.ybml</div>
```js {1|2-4|5-9|13|all}
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        if (x == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
        }
    }
};

puts(fibonacci(10)) // Displays "55".
```
