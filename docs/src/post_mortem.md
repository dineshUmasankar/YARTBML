# Post Mortem YARTBML

Our team was able to create a programming language that supports, conditionals, data structures, functions, arithmetic operations, recursion, and several more features. We also created a syntax highligher as an additional tool to make writing in YARTBML easier. We accomplished these tasks by working collaboratively with the use of a GitHub Kanban and Microsoft Teams. Given the timespan of the project, we are happy with the progress we made. We were able to implement the key components of a programming language which are the lexer, parser, evaluator and REPL. We also fully tested our code to ensure robustness. As a team we have future stretch goals that we would like to meet. These include a more streamlined CLI interface where we can interpret whole files and a language server to run programs in a browser. This project taught us the fine details of making a programming language and the design details that can be made at each step. We also learned the struggles of changing the language design after having a complete language. We are looking forward to further developing this project as we have given ourselves a great base language to work with.
