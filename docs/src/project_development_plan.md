# Project Development Plan

This document defines the project plan for the YARTBML language. The project is broken into components so that developers can work independently of each other. We will be using GitHub projects to manage tasks that need to be completed. The workflow is assigning a task, setting active tasks to in progress, than reviewing tasks, and finally setting them to complete. Initial development will begin with set up of the document generator to convert markdown files to pdf files. Than development of the langauge will begin. Each of the langauge components can be developed congruently and then merged together. The syntax highliter will be developed independently of the langauge development.
